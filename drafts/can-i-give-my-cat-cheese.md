### Can I feed my cat cheese?

A nibble of cheese here and there might be fine. Gabby, for example, loves cheddar and mozzarella. However, only feed your cat a small amount at any given time as cats lack the enzymes necessary to digestÂ _either_ casein or lactose. Some cats lack both enzymes, most cats lack one or the other. Cheese should have high level of casein and lower levels of lactose, but can still upset your kitty's tummy.
