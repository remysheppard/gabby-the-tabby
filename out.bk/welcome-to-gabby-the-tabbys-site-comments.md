Hi Samantha and Gabby, It was very nice of you to drop by. I love to meet new cats and talk abit. You seem to have found a wonderful family. They will love and respect you. Just be yourself Gabby. Maybe have a chat with us next time you stop by and live up to your name. MOL Kitty Kisses, Kali

Hi Gabby and Samantha! Welcome to the world of pet blogs - especially kitty blogs! Gabby you are a cutie - love your eyes.....you sure were lucky to escape a pet store. My Mom and Dad found me at a shelter when I was just a few weeks old and now I'm 16-1/2 !! Thanks for visiting my blog.....and I hope you have as much fun blogging as we've had for several years.....our friends Shoko and Kali and their Mom Jean (The Canadian Cats) are good friends and they're right - this is a wonderful "community" ! If we can help - give us a screeeeeeech! Hugs, Sammy and Mom Pam
