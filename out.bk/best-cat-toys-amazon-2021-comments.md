Those are some great toys! I think that Manna would be interested in trying the Catch the Mouse balls. She enjoys ball toys. :)

I'm all in favor of anything that lets a cat actually hunt! I got some super cute videos tonight of Gabby playing with a starburst candy! lol

So do pictures cost you extra money to put on your website? Would be nice to actually see the product you are talking about.
