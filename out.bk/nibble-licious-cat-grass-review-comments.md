This is a great idea. I used to grow grass for our cats all the time, but...well, I got lazy about keeping up with it. Our male cat really loved it though--I will have to start a little plot of grass again just for him!

I am glad it helps your kitty. Mine always seem to throw up when they have grass.

Neat idea. Sully goes out in his harness to eat the grass and catnip beside the deck steps.

Interesting. I've heard before that cats eat grass to make themselves throw up - because they can't digest it. That said, Bear had a hairball crisis of sorts this past spring - so maybe I'll try grass next year if he still struggles.

Our cat digests it just fine. But there might be certain types of grass that this is absolutely true for. Our Gabby would throw up if she would eat the fern, so we had to get rid of it (ferns usually aren't good for cats because they usually aren't actually ferns!), but she handles this grass great. She also nibbles on our jalapeno plant lol

That is great. I saw cat eat grass several times. In Asia, many people believe that it will be sunny if a cat eats grass.

Oh wow. Another interesting thing to learn. My cats never throw up after eating before unless she's sick and I'll take her to the vet by then but still, it's very interesting to know that grass can be an important in curing the vomiting. Thank you for sharing!
