Great advice ... especially about taking into account whether you can provide a decent standard of living for each cat - regardless of your own desires and wants.

Thank you for this post. It is really useful for cat owners. I had cats but frankly I had not ever known how many little box would be enough for them.

thanks for your useful tips. Honestly, I have never thought of how many boxes are enough for my kitties. Now my kitties will have comfy shelters and I could save money too.

Ooopss!!! Oh no, i have been letting my cats share their litter box together. Reading your post makes me reconsider why didn't i think of this before. I have 4 cats and each two share a litter box. Now i need to buy more

A lot of people don't seem to consider that. They want to talk about how all life is precious, but don't consider the stressful living environment they're creating for their cat. No one wants cats in shelters or on the street, but it's arguably better to provide a great life for one or two cats, than a poor life for a dozen.
