We are not veterinarians!
=========================

The owners and operators of this website absolutely **are not** vets. They have no medical training. All knowledge is learned second hand from various sources and **should not take the place of the professional opinion or advice of a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine!**

If your cat displays _any_ negative behaviors, you should **absolutely** take them to the vet _immediately! _We are not responsible for any injurious outcome to you or your pet or pets if you follow the advice on this site. This stuff worked for us, but we have consulted a professional Doctor of Veterinary Medicine where necessary, and all solutions we've found only pertain to _our cat_. All cats, like people, are different, and solutions need to be tried with care and under professional supervision.
