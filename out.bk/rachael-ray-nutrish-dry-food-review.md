Dry food is a tricky subject because a lot of times it is the most affordable option out there for our pets, and a lot of it seems like it would be healthy. Our vets always recommend dry food, and by and large there doesn't seem to be much of an issue with feeding it. When you really take time to think about it, though, is dry food the best option for your cat?

Imagine if you only had those cheddar cheese gold fish snacks to eat every day, for every meal. Sure, they say they're healthy. They boast about being made with _real cheese_ (as opposed to fake cheese, I guess?). But does that mean they _are_ healthy? Or provide a truly balanced diet that's fit for your needs?
