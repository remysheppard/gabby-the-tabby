I have 13 cats and can’t afford insurance for all an it doesn’t seem right to just have it for some so I guess I would run up all my charge cards. If I only had a few cats, I would definitely get insurance.

I think if you can afford insurance for at least a few of the cats, you should look into it. Maybe just the two or three youngest. The other cats won't know and it might end up saving you some money. On another note: 13! Wow! I bet you get the best bed time cuddles :) Daddy has been lobbying for a second cat, and now he's talking about fostering.
