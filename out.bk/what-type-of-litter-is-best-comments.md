We actually use pine shavings. That seems to work best for us. :)

Yes. We buy All Natural PetPicks Pine Bedding in a very large bag. It doesn't give a weight in pounds. It says it is 2.0 cubic ft. that expands to 4.0 cubic feet. We buy it at Walmart. http://www.walmart.com/ip/Pet-s-Pick-Pine-Bedding-4.0-cu-ft/24232050 Hopefully they are restocked at our local Walmart. lol This bag usually last about a month. It does track out of the litter box but it is easy on the vacuum cleaner. If Sully should lick it off his feet he is not breathing in dust or sand. You can scoop the solids out. and it does control odor well. I usually change the whole box once a week. One of the advantages using these pine shavings... it makes great mulch for our garden and flower beds. :D

The only litter I've EVER used is Arm & Hammer scoopable unscented. I've tried other litters on Sam and - well - it's not been pretty. HAHAHA Hugs, Pam

We're pretty blessed in that our cat adapts easily to change, so we're able to expirament with stuff like this :)

That's good.......Sam is well past the "experiment with this and that" stage......he's definitely set in his ways now!

why do you prefer simply pine to exquisicat pine? I'm thinking of trying the latter because it's so reasonably priced. thank you for the informative blog by the way!!

For us it was a matter of the cheaper pine litters generally feeling like plastic, or overly processed. They didn't function as well at odor elimination, either. To be honest, though, we've gotten a [Litter Robot (best cat purchase ever)](http://share.litter-robot.com/jgr8z) and are using [Fresh Step with Febreeze](https://amzn.to/2TtLo0z). It's the best odor eliminating litter we've run across.
