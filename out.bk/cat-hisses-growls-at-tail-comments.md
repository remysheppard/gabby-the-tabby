Yo! Thanks for visiting. I don't chase my tail but sometimes TW does think I have that FHE thing cos of how I run through the house, attack them and when she pets my back it spasms. She never remembers to ax the vet though. I like that white tail tip. Mine is black and it's the only black I have.

That tail is so cute! The thing about FHE is that its pretty uncommon. IT's something to look out for, but it's likely that you're just a little hyper. Cats can be pretty spazzy :p I know miss Gabby is a super spaz. The back spasm on pets is something most all animals do. If you react with visible pain or discomfort from petting is when we should be worried. But still ask a vet if you're concerned, because vets we are not.

My cat does the tail 24-7 she has a basket full of toys two other cats to play with. Wet food dry food and is a solid black. She screams and growls snaps at her tail but doesn’t bite it. I can cover it up and sometime that helps, it’s driving us crazy. I can hold her and sometimes that works, have tryed everything short of tranquilizers. Have run out of things to do for her,

Same problem as Alice Rodin. We have two cats that play together, basket full of toys, roller circuit, premium food, and one of the cats is completely destroying his tail. The other day it looked like a blood bath. Holding his tail or covering it with a blanket stops it. Completely at a loss of what to do next.

My cat does this. He gets really angry at it. Sometimes it sounds like he’s fighting with another cat.

A lot of times the "bite for no reason" is because the cat is _over stimulated_ and has a lot of angst or energy built up and doesn't quite know what to do. They end up taking it out on us or other cats! If you're playing and see your cat starting to get worked up, give an appropriate toy to help them wind down (like a [Kitty Kick Stix](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=998244&u=1295391&m=36868&urllink=&afftrack=0) kicker toy!).

I have a 7 year old Siamese named Chloe who has this. She spends most of every day flipping her tail and growling and hissing at it. If we touch her anywhere below her head, she acts like her skins is super itchy or extremely sensitive. If I don’t keep her nails cut short she will SHRED her tail. I was having a rummage sale once and I was outside for most of the day. When I came in it looked like there had been a massacre in my apartment. There was blood everywhere! Her tail had several long gashes in it where it was laid open and bleeding quite a bit. I cleaned her up and dressed the wounds. Took her to the vet the next day. He said he was hesitant to diagnose her with FHE because it is so rare. He suggested that we have her tail removed. However that is possibly not going to stop the behavior. I took her to a different vet who told me he is pretty sure that she does have FHE, and that the best thing I can do for her is interactive play and switch out her toys and boxes on a regular basis. She gets a new box every week and we hide most of the toys and give them to her on a rotation. This has seemed to help. She loves boxes and sometimes I just give her an open box and sometimes I cut holes in a closed box that she can go through. The boxes are the single best thing for her because she loves them. My local grocery store gets their truck in on Mondays and Thursdays and are very willing to let me get a new box for her at least once a week. Thanks for the article. It was very informative and helpful. I hope this post will be helpful to others who have a cat who is suffering from this bizarre illness.

I'm sorry you have that problem with your sweet Chloe! But I'm also glad you found a vet who is willing to consider FHE and that you've got a pretty good system in place. Thankfully none of our cats have FHE because I know it can be difficult!

I have a cat hissing / growling at his tail for months. but I see no signs of it bleeding, the tails moves just fine, and it looks perfectly normal. I can touch the tail without it being too much an issue for him. He grooms the tail sometimes as well. Unfortunately the tail has been stepped on quite a few times accidently with kids - I hope it wasn't injured or broken. How can you tell if the cat has been injured? From what I see the main concern should be when they cant feel their tails as it could be injured or broken.

The best way to find out if the tail is injured is to take the cat to a vet! But it sounds like it's just play. Growling at the tail isn't abnormal during play, and the cat is grooming it later, so he knows it's a part of him.
