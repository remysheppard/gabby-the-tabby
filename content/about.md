My name is Samantha, and my husband Sidney and I have the most precious little kitty in the world! Her name is Gabitha LeeAnn, we call her "Gabby" for short!

We first got Gabby when she was a little less than a year old, and we found her at the best little pet store in Lynchburg, Virginia - where we were vacationing for Thanksgiving. We fell in love with her right away and absolutely had to bring her back home with us!

So started a wonderful, sometimes trying, relationship with the world's cutest kitty.

Gabby is absolutely wonderful. She's now three years old and very, very playful. All of the time. Especially at five in the morning. She loves to go "hunting" at the windows, and even out on the porch, but she's a Fraidy Cat, so she always makes sure to have an exit.

Gabby weighs a perfect 9.5 pounds, exactly where she needs to be, and is her veterinarian's "Dental Health All Star". This is thanks to Hubby who measures out her food, and researches all of the ingredients and things before we switch her.

After we got her, in fact, Hubby spent God only knows how much on books and videos about cat behavior, biology, and health. Hours researching the animal online, as well. He wanted to make sure he knew everything there was to know about these precious animals before we got one!

We decided, with such a healthy, beautiful, kitty, how could we _not_ share her with the world!? So we decided to start an [instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/gabby.the.tabby/) & this blog.

We hope you enjoy seeing snapshots of our lives with this wonderful little creature!

## Update: February 28th, 2022

This was written when we first launched this site back in 2014. Since then Gabby has had the most wonderful little life that a kitty could hope for. Unfortunately, though, from 2021 to 2022 she began having severe health problems.

Despite spending over $5,000 and doing everything we could, her situation was unfixable. Throughout her life, Gabby struggled with very severe *pica*. We did everything we could to make sure she didn't ingest things she shouldn't, but nothing can be 100%.

In the end she ingested things that caused irreparable damage and there was no medical or surgical intervention available that would have been able to fix the problem.

Finally, on February 28th, 2022 we made the most difficult decision and had her humanely euthanized.

It was the hardest thing we've ever had to do, and we miss her so dearly. 

We thank you for your thoughts and prayers. We are both devout Christians and, while we do not believe she has 'crossed the rainbow bridge', we are grateful for the sentiment. We loved our cat so dearly, and we trust that our Lord and God will resurrect her on The Day.

We're leaving this site up to help other cat owners, as well as to serve as a memorial to our sweet Gabibberly (as we called her).
