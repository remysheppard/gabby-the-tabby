If you own a cat then you know that everything in your home is an object to be climbed upon, pawed at, and otherwise rubbed by your [feline housemates](https://www.gabbythetabby.com/cat-think-im-mom-dad/). That is what makes Cat Trees so indispensable to a cat owner! Imagine: A piece of furniture in your home for your cat. It serves no purpose other than to be climbed on, clawed at, and headbutted.

We are huge fans of **Cat Trees** here at Gabby The Tabby! That's why we have put together a list of the **9 Best Cat Trees Amazon Has to Offer** for you here today.
