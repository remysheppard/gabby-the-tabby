I was talking to my mom the other day and I mentioned that little Gabby was sneezing a little bit more than usual. My mom said, "Well I would suggest maybe its allergies, but that's ridiculous, isn't it?"Â **Not at all!**

Cats can, and sometimes do, get seasonal allergies, just like people! Allergies are simply when your body fights off a physical foreign body like it would a bacteria or virus. Its an immune response to a foreign body, and not necessarily an illness. Things like pollen, cigarette smoke, certain types of wood, pet dander, foods, and various others can trigger an allergic reaction in a person.

And just like you, all of these things can trigger an allergic reaction in a cat as well.
